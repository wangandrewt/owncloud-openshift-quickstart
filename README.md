ownCloud on OpenShift
=========================

ownCloud is a flexible, open source file sync and share solution. Whether using a mobile device, a workstation, or a web client, ownCloud provides the ability to put the right files at their employeesâ€™ fingertips on any device in one simple-to-use, secure, private and controlled solution.

Think of ownCloud as a way to roll your own Google Drive or Dropbox on-premise solution.

About this Fork
---------

This fork supports upgrading between ownCloud versions. Update `install_version` in *.openshift/action_hooks/build*, commit the change, push to your OpenShift, and open the application in your browser to complete the upgrade.

Previous ownCloud versions will not be removed from *${OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR}/current*. Delete them after finishing the upgrade.

1. SSH to Openshift: `rhc ssh -a <app-name>`
1. Change to *${OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR}/current*: `cd app-root/data/current`
1. Remove the old directory: `rm -r <old-version>`
